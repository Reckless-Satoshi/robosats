## High risk payment method

The best practice for user try to transact with payment method with high risk of lossing funds is disscussed in this section.

### Paypal
Paypal is a popular international payment method. However, this platform <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/buyer-protection">Buyer protection policy</a>, it is possible for buyer to do fraudulent activity by creating a refund request in Paypal after trading process in Robosats is finished and therefore taking both fiat and bitcoin all by themselves. 

This fraud can be prevent by agreeing with the buyer to have them send money using the “send money to a friend or family member” option. This will make the buyer become the one liability for transaction fee and make it less likely for them requesting refund.

If you are a seller and your peer both agreed to use “send money to a friend or family member” but your peer use "send money for Goods or Services" option, you should return the fiat payment and ask your peer to send with agreed method. If they're insist to break the agreement, you may ask them to voluntary end the trade or end the trade by calling dispute.
