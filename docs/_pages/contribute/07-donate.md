<!-- We do not think RoboSats should rely on donations in order to stay active. Your best way to donate to RoboSats is to actively make use of the platform and tell your friends.

We do however, appreciate donations, since the platform runs at a loss at the moment and development is hard to fund. 

You can donate by:
 1. Directly tipping the developer working on the features you like. Check the active PRs and show your support to the community developers with Lightning Tips
 2. Via KeySend to RoboSats node: (linked to Node ID)
 3. Via an on-chain transaction to: ADDRESS (address tied to RoboSats LN node funding wallet) -->
