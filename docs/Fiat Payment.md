# Practical guideline for fiat transaction

Because Robosats is a decentralized bitcoin exchange that allows users to exchange between fiat currency and bitcoin like bisq.
<br>We encourage users to follow the fiat payment guide provided in bisq wiki <a href="https://bisq.wiki/Payment_methods">here</a>  

However, in Robosats, there is a time limit of 24 hours to complete the fiat exchange. So, users should use instant payment method to prevent order expiration.
as order expiration will automatically trigger the dispute.

## Available Fiat Payment method

Currently, there is no fiat payment method limitation like bisq, users can use higher risk payment method such as Paypal, Venmo and Cash App.
